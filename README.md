A webpage evenly divided into 4 panels, each of which displays a webmap from a different provider:

1. OpenStreetMap
2. Google Maps
3. Yandex Maps
4. 2GIS

## Goals

* Learn how to use web map APIs from major vendors
* See what's similar and what's unique in each of them
* Have the ability to compare dirrent vendors' coverage of the same area easily

## Building

    bundle install
    bundle exec middleman build

Web assets will be written to the `docs` folder.
